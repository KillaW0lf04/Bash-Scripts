Bash-Scripts
============

A set of bash scripts i wrote during my time developing. While most will not be complicated, they are written for pure convenience when writing in the command line.

In order to make proper use of them, the following should be done:

- Rename the approriate file to exclude the .sh extension. (For example *explore.sh* should be renamed to *explore*)
- Give the file executable permissions: type *chmod +x explore*
- Move the file to the /usr/bin: type *sudo mv explore /usr/bin*

You may know run the file in any directory by typing its file name (in this example *explore*)
